## Samples

Ping provides these Android samples to help demonstrate SDK functionality/implementation. They are provided "as is" and are not official products of Ping and are not officially supported.

### Integrate with PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud / PingAM:

To try out the Ping Android SDK please look at one of our samples:

- [**Java Authenticator - `/java-authenticator`**](./java-authenticator/)
  
  - This Authenticator sample app supports registration of multiple accounts and multiple different authentication methods in each account, such as push notifications and one-time passwords.

- [**Java UI prototype - `/java-ui-prototype`**](./java-ui-prototype/)
  
  - An example Android project making full use of the Ping SDK with a prototyping UI. Allows to explore the SDK uses in detail with example calls for running Journeys, getting OAuth2.0 tokens, User Info and more.
