## Samples

Ping provides these Flutter samples to help demonstrate SDK functionality/implementation. They are provided "as is" and are not official products of Ping and are not officially supported.

### Integrate with PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud / PingAM:

To try out the Ping iOS and Android SDKs in a Flutter application please look at one of our samples:

- [**FR Example - `/flutter_todo/`**](./flutter_todo/)
  
  - An example Flutter project making use of the iOS and Android SDKs to demonstrate the use of the Native SDKs on a Hybrid framework like flutter with a use of a bridging layer. The app makes use of the [`../javascript/todo-api/`](../javascript/todo-api/) project as a backend storage mechanism for the `To-Do` list.

## Requirements

- Latest Xcode
