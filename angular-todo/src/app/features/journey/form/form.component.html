  Render conditions for presenting appropriate views to user.
  First, we need to handle no "step", which means we are waiting for the initial response from AM for authentication.
  Once we have a step, we then need to ensure we don't already have a success or failure. If we have a step but don't have a success or failure, we will likely have callbacks that we will need to present to the user in their render component form.

      Since there is no step information we need to call AM to retrieve the instructions for rendering the login form.
